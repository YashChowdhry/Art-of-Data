1. Discuss how you used the API to obtain the dataset.


2. Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.


3. How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!


4. Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
Submit your Python file(s) and a link to your blog post on Google Classroom.
