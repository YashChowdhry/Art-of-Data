## 1. Discuss how you used the API to obtain the dataset.

Lets breakdown the code to understand how we were able to access the dataset via the API:

To access the API, python requires us to use the **requests** library. This library is used to make HTTP requests which simplifies the process of retrieving HTML content from websites.

~~~
Import requests
~~~

How do we actually send over the request the website? 

~~~
payload = {"key": "YashArtOfDataKEY123ABCsecret", "idx": idx} 
	url = f"https://afeingoldhm.pythonanywhere.com/socks"
	response = requests.get(url, params = payload)
~~~

The **payload** contains two key-value pairs, the key and idx. The key was needed to access the API, it serves as a password, and the idx was used to retrieve the information of a given index, it was a line by line process.  The url variable stores the url of the API with the specific endpoint we are working with. We then use the function **requests.get()** to actually make the request to the indicated url, and it provides the payload, the parameters needed to access the API. 

## 2. Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.


## 3. How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!


## 4. Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
Submit your Python file(s) and a link to your blog post on Google Classroom.
