1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
This study dealt with the effects of long-term creatine supplementation on most broadly the sprint performance at the end of endurance cycling exercise. 

Null hypothesis: ingestion of 3g/day of creatine monohydrate for 28 days does not 1) increase muscle creatine phosphate and total creatine content at rest and at the end of prolonged endurance exercise; and 2) [does not] increase sprint performance at the end of a prolonged bout of endurance exercise.
Alternate hypothesis: ingestion of 3g/day of creatine monohydrate for 28 days does 1) increase muscle creatine phosphate and total creatine content at rest and at the end of prolonged endurance exercise; and 2) [does] increase sprint performance at the end of a prolonged bout of endurance exercise.

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?
The data was collected and analyzed by the authors of the study themselves. As stated in the acknowledgements section, all five authors contributed to at least either data collection, analysis, or both.

Data analysis: Robert C Hickner, David J Dyck
Data collection: Josh Sklar, Holly Hatley, Priscilla Byrd


3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?


4. Why are they interested in this data?
The background hints that the motivation to research such a topic stemmed from the lack of information and conflicting data. 
They state there is limited research on whether creatine supplementation can effectively elevate muscle creatine phosphate content and maintain it during prolonged endurance exercise. 
Of the five studies analyzing creatine effects on a duration greater than 20 minutes, three have shown increased performance whereas the other two demonstrate a decreased or constant performance. There are not enough studies to effectively corroborate data neither are the studies showing similar results encouraging more researchers to pursue this field. 
The test subjects are experienced athletes. There are plenty of studies demonstrating that 20g/day creatine use in the short term has positively influenced intermittent exercise performance, but there is a lack of data regarding chronic, long-term, creatine supplementation and its effects on muscle creatine phosphate levels and performance.  

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
Required data:
Body weight
Percent body fat
VO2(oxygen consumption) peak = peak aerobic capacity

Blood sample from forearm vein before and after 28 days
Oxygen consumption
VO2 determined using sensormedic
Diet
Final sprint times
Power output
RER values
Submaximal oxygen consumption
Plasma glucose
Blood lactate
Hemoglobin
Hematocrit
Resting plasma volume
Muscle total creatine
Muscle creatine phosphate
Muscle creatine
Muscle atp
Muscle lactate
Muscle glycogen
Muscle fiber composition

Data that could be left out:



6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?
It can be concluded that although creatine supplementation may increase resting muscle total creatine, muscle creatine phosphate, and plasma volume, and may lead to a reduction in oxygen consumption during submaximal exercise, creatine supplementation does not improve sprint performance at the end of endurance cycling exercise.

Conclusions:
Plasma volume increases with creatine supplementation at 3 g/day for 28 days
Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post-supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group (+14.0 ± 6.3%) than the placebo group (-10.4 ± 4.4%; P < 0.05) at 90 minutes of exercise.
Muscle total creatine and creatine phosphate increase with creation supplementation at 3 g/day for 28 days
There was a 24.5 ± 10.0% increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 ± 23.9% increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group
Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride, as well as VO2 peak, were not affected by creatine supplementation
To find
Submaximal oxygen consumption near the end of the two-hour ride was decreased by approximately 10% by creatine supplementation
Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post-supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group (+14.0 ± 6.3%) than the placebo group (-10.4 ± 4.4%; P < 0.05) at 90 minutes of exercise
The time of the final sprint to exhaustion at the end of the 2-hour cycling bout was not affected by creatine supplementation
creatine pre, 64.4 ± 13.5s; creatine post, 88.8 ± 24.6s; placebo pre, 69.0 ± 24.8s; placebo post 92.8 ± 31.2s: creatine vs. placebo not significant
Power output for the final sprint was increased 
by ~33% in both groups (creatine vs. placebo not significant)


7. How was this study funded?
The study was supported by a Grant from the North Carolina Institute of Nutrition. The University of North Carolina Nutrition Research Institute (UNC NRI) recruits scientists to conduct “innovative basic and translational science studying how individual differences in requirements and responses to diet affect our individual nutritional needs.” (UNC NRI) 

8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?
I believe the publish or perish philosophy did have an effect on the study, both in the question they addressed and the procedure. 
The study addressed long-term creatine supplementation in prolonged exercise, a field in which only five studies have been published. The limited nature increases the likelihood that any results achieved would be significant. 
The data collection stage only required 28 days, relatively quick compared to experiments in other fields. 
There were lots of references to p-values < 0.05: submaximal oxygen consumption, greater body mass, and final power output increase just to name a few. Several metrics in the study yielded statistically significant/publishable p-values suggesting the procedure was p-hacked or designed in a manner that encompassed several “testable” metrics, subsequently, boosting the probability of publishability.
