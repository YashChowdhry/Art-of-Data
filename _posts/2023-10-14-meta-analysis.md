**1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**

This study dealt with the effects of long-term creatine supplementation on most broadly the sprint performance at the end of endurance cycling exercise. 

Null hypothesis: ingestion of 3g/day of creatine monohydrate for 28 days does not 1) increase muscle creatine phosphate and total creatine content at rest and at the end of prolonged endurance exercise; and 2) [does not] increase sprint performance at the end of a prolonged bout of endurance exercise.

Alternate hypothesis: ingestion of 3g/day of creatine monohydrate for 28 days does 1) increase muscle creatine phosphate and total creatine content at rest and at the end of prolonged endurance exercise; and 2) [does] increase sprint performance at the end of a prolonged bout of endurance exercise.

**2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**

The data was collected and analyzed by the authors of the study themselves. As stated in the acknowledgements section, all five authors contributed to at least either data collection or analysis.

Data analysis: Robert C Hickner, David J Dyck
Data collection: Josh Sklar, Holly Hatley, Priscilla Byrd

**3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**

The study references quite a few sources, some of which involve conducting other experiments and subsequently collecting data. Most of the sources are public and few require payment, however, not all the data is always presented. Some experiments deal with several test subjects but report the data with only the median change: initial-value += median change. 

Example datasets:
Distribution of glycogen concentration values from quadriceps femoris
cycling work output (watts), blood lactate accumulation, plasma accumulation of hypoxanthine, oxygen uptake → used to determine higher initial creatine phosphate content and an increased rate of creatine phosphate resynthesis
Muscle ATP concentration in doing three isometric contractions
Muscle ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), and lactate concentrations were measured from biopsy samples of vastus lateralis muscle after varying recovery times
Muscle total creatine concentration after consuming 20g/day creatine
Blood ammonia accumulation during pre and post creatine supplementation

The first source was published in Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation, and thus not available to me, but it is still public

**4. Why are they interested in this data?**

Interest in above data:
Some of the references were used in explaining the background information and have generally been accepted as true. For example, muscle creatine phosphate content has been shown to decline during prolonged or creatine supplementation can increase muscle creatine phosphate content. A few of the references present conflicting data as described in the background to highlight the varying results. These datasets were not directly used to come to conclusions, but more so used to influence the procedure of the study.  For example, the distribution of the glycogen concentration helps unpack the implications of glycogen storage in the muscles on endurance. 

Interested in exploring further:
The background hints that the motivation to research such a topic stemmed from the lack of information and conflicting data. 
They state there is limited research on whether creatine supplementation can effectively elevate muscle creatine phosphate content and maintain it during prolonged endurance exercise. 
Of the five studies analyzing creatine effects on a duration greater than 20 minutes, three have shown increased performance whereas the other two demonstrate a decreased or constant performance. There are not enough studies to effectively corroborate data neither are the studies showing similar results encouraging more researchers to pursue this field. 
The test subjects are experienced athletes. There are plenty of studies demonstrating that 20g/day creatine use in the short term has positively influenced intermittent exercise performance, but there is a lack of data regarding chronic, long-term, creatine supplementation and its effects on muscle creatine phosphate levels and performance.  

**5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?**

Required data:
Body weight

Percent body fat

Oxygen consumption(VO2) peak = peak aerobic capacity

Training distance cycled per week

Recorded data:

Diet

Muscle biopsy from quadricep femoris before and after 28 days

Blood sample from forearm vein before and after 28 days

Oxygen consumption

VO2 peak 

Final sprint times

Power output(watts)

Respiratory exchange ratios(RER)

Plasma glucose concentration

Blood lactate concentration

Hemoglobin concentration

Hematocrit concentration

Resting plasma volume

Muscle total creatine concentration

Muscle creatine phosphate content

Muscle creatine concentration

Muscle ATP content

Muscle lactate concentration

Muscle glycogen content

Muscle fiber composition

Data that could be left out:
The muscle biopsy could maybe include more factors like muscle metabolites or enzymes specific to energy output and other variables related to exercise

I don’t think there was a reference to micro muscle tears post workout and how those could influence future output. Soreness was mentioned but that is not an accurate indicator of muscle tears.

Subjects only followed an identical diet three days in advance. Exploring how the varying diets could influence muscle repair, blood lactate, or creatine levels was not explained.

**6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?**

It can be concluded that although creatine supplementation may increase resting muscle total creatine, muscle creatine phosphate, and plasma volume, and may lead to a reduction in oxygen consumption during submaximal exercise, creatine supplementation does not improve sprint performance at the end of endurance cycling exercise.

Statement: Plasma volume increases with creatine supplementation at 3 g/day for 28 days

Evidence: Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post-supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group (+14.0 ± 6.3%) than the placebo group (-10.4 ± 4.4%; P < 0.05) at 90 minutes of exercise.

Statement: Muscle total creatine and creatine phosphate increase with creation supplementation at 3 g/day for 28 days

Evidence: There was a 24.5 ± 10.0% increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 ± 23.9% increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group

Statement: Power output for the final sprint was increased 

Evidence: ~33% in both groups (creatine vs. placebo not significant)

Statement + Evidence: Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post-supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group (+14.0 ± 6.3%) than the placebo group (-10.4 ± 4.4%; P < 0.05) at 90 minutes of exercise

Statement + Evidence: The time of the final sprint to exhaustion at the end of the 2-hour cycling bout was not affected by creatine supplementation creatine pre, 64.4 ± 13.5s; creatine post, 88.8 ± 24.6s; placebo pre, 69.0 ± 24.8s; placebo post 92.8 ± 31.2s: creatine vs. placebo not significant

**7. How was this study funded?**

The study was supported by a Grant from the North Carolina Institute of Nutrition. The University of North Carolina Nutrition Research Institute (UNC NRI) recruits scientists to conduct “innovative basic and translational science studying how individual differences in requirements and responses to diet affect our individual nutritional needs.” (UNC NRI) 

**8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?**

I believe the publish or perish philosophy did have an effect on the study, both in the question they addressed and the procedure. 
The study addressed long-term creatine supplementation in prolonged exercise, a field in which only five studies have been published. The limited nature increases the likelihood that any results achieved would be significant. 
The data collection stage only required 28 days, relatively quick compared to experiments in other fields. 
There were lots of references to p-values < 0.05: submaximal oxygen consumption, greater body mass, and final power output increase just to name a few. Several metrics in the study yielded statistically significant/publishable p-values suggesting the procedure was p-hacked or designed in a manner that encompassed several “testable” metrics, subsequently, boosting the probability of publishability.
