## Which dataset did you work with?

I worked with a dataset that dealt with information on Netflix films and series. There was a combination of ordinal data such as number of hours watched, runtime, and position on Netflix’s top 10 list, and also categorical data such as English or non-english. 

## Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?

I wanted to work with this dataset because it felt more resonable than others that compared crop yields. This dataset offered variables I could easily make compare to one another with a preexisting idea of what to expect. I hoped to test the accuracy of my hypotheses by choosing this dataset and I will also be able to understand the preferences of the average netflix user.

## Discuss your analysis of the dataset. Include details such as...
**Analyzed variables:**

I used most of the variables in this dataset in one way or another. It offered the category (film or series), its highest netflix ranking, the season titles, hours viewed, number of views, and runtime.

**Distributions of variables (center and variability):**

I used a boxplot to show the distribution of the hours watched. Understanding that the watch hours of series is significantly larger than that of films, it makes sense to see a few larger outliers as depicted with the circles.

This image is also a boxplot but this one represents the distribution of the number of views. The more views, the more the watch hours, generally speaking, I would expect a box plot that looks similar to the one of the view hours. They are similar, there are larger outliers in both and the interquartile range sits to the left in both.

**Relationships between variables and their visualizations**

I used this scatterplot for practice so it’t not as meaningful as the other ones. Films have comparable runtimes whereas series don’t. From this we can identify that English films have more views than non English films so we can conclude that English films are more popular or there are Netflix subscribers that prefer English. As per the series, we can sort of see that English series have a longer runtime than non English series; they are continued longer.

This bargraph compares the hours viewed based on category. We can conclude that English films are more watched than non English films, and English series are more watched than non-english series. If I were to start my own entertainment platform, using this information, I’d be inclined to purchase entertainment in English, and also series as opposed to films.

One would assume that the higher a film or series ranked, the more that they were watched, and this does seem to be the case. As the rank lowers, so do the hours viewed for the most part but there is an exceptionally large drop down from the 1 spot to the 2. Maybe this means that subscribers actually use the ranking to help decide what they watch. Most people would pick the highest ranked, which helps explain the fall off and less change between the ones ranked lower down.

I have been generally using the hours viewed as a metric for the popularity of a film or show. Im sort of thinking about it from the perspective of me owning an entertainment platform, what would get me the most watch hours? I compared the watch hours of season 1 of a show and the rest of the seasons. It showed that season 1 was just barely more watched than the other seasons indicating that people usually stick to a series they have started.

This barograph compares the average views between movies with a runtime greater than 2 hours and less than 2 hours. Again, they were pretty similar indicating the fact that people don’t mind the length of the film they watch.

**Limitations of your analysis and the dataset**

This graph helps show a limitation and inaccuracy of the dataset. I divided the hours by the runtime and compared that to the views. Each data point has the same x and y value which means that each person that watched the filmm watched it for the full runtime. This is not really ever the case which means that the data is not correct.

I tried to use whatever information was provided to understand the behaviors of the users. I could have made more progress if I had information such as the genres of the films, when they were made, if they were only available on Netflix, etc. Also, if I wanted to make assumptions about films and series in general, I would need a dataset that wasn’t just limited to Netflix, but rather all other streaming platforms too. 

**What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence?**

Within each response I provided a conclusion about certain aspects of the dataset drawing conclusions from graphs. If I was to start my own entertainment platform, only factoring in this data, I would prioritize series over films, and those that are spoken in english.
