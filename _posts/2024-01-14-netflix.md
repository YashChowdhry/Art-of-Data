## Which dataset did you work with?

I worked with a dataset that dealt with information on Netflix films and series. There was a combination of ordinal data such as number of hours watched, runtime, and position on Netflixâ€™s top 10 list, and also categorical data such as English or non-english. 

## Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?

I wanted to work with this dataset because it felt more resonable than others that compared crop yields. This dataset offered variables I could easily make compare to one another with a preexisting idea of what to expect. I hoped to test the accuracy of my hypotheses by choosing this dataset and I will also be able to understand the preferences of the average netflix user.

## Discuss your analysis of the dataset. Include details such as...
**Analyzed variables:**

**Distributions of variables (center and variability):**
