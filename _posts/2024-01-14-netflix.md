## Which dataset did you work with?

I worked with a dataset that dealt with information on Netflix films and series. There was a combination of ordinal data such as number of hours watched, runtime, and position on Netflix’s top 10 list, and also categorical data such as English or non-english. 

## Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?

I wanted to work with this dataset because it felt more resonable than others that compared crop yields. This dataset offered variables I could easily make compare to one another with a preexisting idea of what to expect. I hoped to test the accuracy of my hypotheses by choosing this dataset and I will also be able to understand the preferences of the average netflix user.

## Discuss your analysis of the dataset. Include details such as...
**Analyzed variables:**

I used most of the variables in this dataset in one way or another. It offered the category (film or series), its highest netflix ranking, the season titles, hours viewed, number of views, and runtime.

**Distributions of variables (center and variability):**

I used a boxplot to show the distribution of the hours watched. Understanding that the watch hours of series is significantly larger than that of films, it makes sense to see a few larger outliers as depicted with the circles.

This image is also a boxplot but this one represents the distribution of the number of views. The more views, the more the watch hours, generally speaking, I would expect a box plot that looks similar to the one of the view hours. They are similar, there are larger outliers in both and the interquartile range sits to the left in both.

**Relationships between variables and their visualizations**

I used this scatterplot for practice so it’t not as meaningful as the other ones. Films have comparable runtimes whereas series don’t. From this we can identify that English films have more views than non English films so we can conclude that English films are more popular or there are Netflix subscribers that prefer English. As per the series, we can sort of see that English series have a longer runtime than non English series; they are continued longer.
