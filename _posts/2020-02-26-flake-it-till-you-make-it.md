This lab was easily translatable from the penguins practice, so I relied mainly on that. The syntax was more of a struggle than the problem solving aspect of the lab. Each problem has a simple approach except for question three. I had begun to write a code that would effectively tell me each possible sequence of teams that would satisfy the criteria because I didnâ€™t want to find an easy way out, but was unable to do so. As we were walking home, I asked Thomas his approach which was the one I had already thought of, searching for each Digimon with a memory less than 5 and attack greater than 100. I use this approach in my code but am still trying to figure out a way to find every possible combination. Another struggle I encountered was the way in which my files are stored. I still have yet to move around my files, but Feingold was able to figure out where I went wrong. 

Originally, I had thought that writing this type of code was very difficult, but the moment I took some time to really understand what each line of code did, I truly understood how the code was running and now it is a lot easier and frankly more fun.
